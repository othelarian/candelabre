# Candelabre - Core

Eh! Welcome!

This lib serves as a safe layer between candelabre windowing and widgets libs
and the OpenGL context(s) unsafe API, by providing all the basic tools to
interact with OpenGL. There is few things to say, as in a classic pipeline this
lib won't be call directly, or at least it's the initial goal. But if you want
to use raw OpenGL with candelabre project, you may be interesting by what you
can find here.

Feel free to open an issue!
